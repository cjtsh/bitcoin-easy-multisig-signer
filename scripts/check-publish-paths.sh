# Refuse a second publish path on any ref.
#
# Why this exists: the cycle-3 audit graded the repository BLOCKED because
# .github/workflows/build-windows.yml and build-linux.yml were still live on
# the windows-port and linux-port branches while build-candidate.yml claimed
# no second publish path could attach bytes to a release. The claim was
# checked only against the local checkout, which is exactly why it survived.
#
# This script enumerates the REMOTE's heads, not the checkout, so a branch
# that was never merged can still be seen. Run it as a release gate on every
# dispatch. It is pure bash + git (no gh, no Python, no grep) so it runs the
# same on the Windows job and in a fixture repo on a laptop.
#
#   bash scripts/check-publish-paths.sh [remote]   # default: origin
#
# A ref is "publish-capable" when its workflows either
#   - are named build-windows.yml or build-linux.yml (the retired publishers),
#     or
#   - grant `contents: write` or run `gh release` (the release job that
#     actually attaches bytes).
# Only the default branch (main) may carry one. Comments in a recipe that
# merely name the retired files are not publishers and are not flagged.
#
# FAIL CLOSED. The first version of this script read each workflow body with
# `git show ref:path 2>/dev/null || true` and matched it with `grep`. On the
# Windows job that read returned nothing, `|| true` swallowed the failure, and
# a branch that publishes was reported clean. Four tests went red there while
# staying green on Mac and Linux, which is the only reason anyone noticed. So:
#   - the body comes from `git cat-file blob <oid>`, not `git show ref:path`,
#     because the object id is not a path and cannot be mangled;
#   - a body that cannot be read is itself an offender (`unreadable-workflow`),
#     never a pass;
#   - matching is `[[ ]]` under nocasematch, with no external tool whose
#     absence could turn a refusal into silence.
